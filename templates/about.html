			<div>Greetmaster is an e-card museum.</div>
			<div>Its collection consists of e-cards published by American Greetings and its subsidiaries between 1995 and 2007. Virtually the entire early history of American Greetings' e-card catalog is represented, as well as that of Blue Mountain Arts, Egreetings Network, BeatGreets.com, and others.</div>
			<div>As most of the e-cards were developed on top of now-deprecated technologies, the following open-source projects are utilized to ensure they can be viewed in modern browsers:</div>
			<div>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle">Ruffle</a> for playback of Flash e-cards</li>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/spessasus/spessasynth_lib">SpessaSynth</a> for playback of MIDI audio in HTML e-cards</li>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/caiiiycuk/js-dos">js-dos</a> for playback of Shockwave and executable e-cards</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>The e-card metadata had to be reconstructed from Wayback Machine snapshots. As a result, you may notice that some e-cards have detailed title and category information, while others have none at all.</div>
			<div>Greetmaster is still in active development. You can grab the raw dataset from <a href="https://archive.org/details/imgag.com">here</a>, while the source code for the website can be found <a href="https://github.com/WumboSpasm/greetmaster">here</a>.</div>
