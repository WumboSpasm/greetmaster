	<div>Greetmaster is an e-card museum.</div>
	<div>Its collection consists of e-cards published by American Greetings and its subsidiaries between 1995 and 2007. Virtually the entire early history of American Greetings' e-card catalog is represented, as well as that of Blue Mountain Arts, Egreetings Network, BeatGreets.com, and others.</div>
	<div>As most of the e-cards were developed on top of now-deprecated technologies, the following open-source projects are utilized to ensure they can be viewed in modern browsers:</div>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle">Ruffle</a> for playback of Flash e-cards</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/spessasus/spessasynth_lib">SpessaSynth</a> for playback of MIDI audio in HTML e-cards</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/caiiiycuk/js-dos">js-dos</a> for playback of Shockwave and downloadable e-cards</li>
	</ul>
	<div>The title and category information was reconstructed from Wayback Machine snapshots of e-card catalogs. As a result, you may notice that some e-cards have detailed information about them, while others have none at all.</div>
	<div>You can grab the raw dataset used by Greetmaster from <a href="https://archive.org/details/imgag.com">here</a>, while the source code for the web server can be found <a href="https://github.com/WumboSpasm/greetmaster">here</a>.</div>

	Greetmaster is not affiliated in any way with American Greetings Corporation or its subsidiaries. All e-card content on this website belongs to them.
